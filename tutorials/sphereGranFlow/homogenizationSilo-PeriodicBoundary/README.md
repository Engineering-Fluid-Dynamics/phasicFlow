# Simulating a simple homogenization silo using periodic boundary 

## Problem
A homogenization silo is used to mix particles inside a silo using the circulation of particles. A pneumatic conveying system is used to carry particles at the exit and re-enter them from the top. Here, we use a `periodic` boundary to simulate the action of the pneumatic conveyor system for circulating particles. Particles that are exiting from the bottom are re-entered from top using this boundary (`periodic`).
