# Benchmarks

Benchmakrs has been done on two different simulations: simulation with simple geometry (rotating drum) and a simulation with complex geometry (helical mixer). These benchmarks are used to show how PhasicFlow performs in different scenarios.

- [rotating drum](./rotatingDrum/)
- [helical mixer](./helicalMixer/)

**Note:** If you have performed benchmarks with PhasicFlow using other hardware or software other than PhasicFlow, we would be happy to include them in this section. Please open an issue for more arrangements or send a pull request with the benchmarks results.
